# FailDataTracker

This addon collects event data as you do activities in Classic WoW.  Upon leveling up it will give you a text readout (or popup if activated with `/fdt popup on`) that summarizes what you've done in the last level. For example:

Or for any level if you type the command manually:

Additionally, it tracks time played on each level and real-world time spent on each level.
